--------------------------------Numeric Testcases-------------------------------

############### Step 1

1.1 Run ./numerics < testcases/input1.txt
****************
defined f(x y z)
f(3 4.2 5) = 14.6 [CORRECT]
f(-1 9.2 6) = -6.2 [CORRECT]

It is correct. The define sentence is legal and the expression is legal, so it
can be defined successfully. The two test sentences are legal so it can be
parsed to see if it is correct. The evaluation of the function is equal to the
answer. Therefore, there are key words correct at the end of each line.

1.2 Run ./numerics < testcases/input2.txt
****************
defined f(x y z)
f(3 4 5) = 14 [CORRECT]
f(3    4   5) = 14 [CORRECT]

It is correct. As above, the define sentence and test sentence are legal.The
evaluation of the function is equal to the answer so there are CORRECT behind
them. Also, according to the specifications, an arbitrary amount of spaces may
appear between (but not inside of) any tokens (id, fname, parens, numeric
constants) without altering the meaning. Therefore, the two test sentences has
the same meaning and result.

1.3 Run ./numerics < testcases/input3.txt
